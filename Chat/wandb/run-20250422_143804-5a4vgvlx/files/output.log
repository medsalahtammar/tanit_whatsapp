### Section Details
- **Title**: Intracytoplasmic sperm injection vs. conventional in vitro fertilization in patients with non-male factor infertility
- **Text**: This retrospective analysis was performed using primary IVF clinic data collected by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART).All data were collected by SART, validated and audited annually, and reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in compliance with the Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-493).
- **DOI**: 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2022.06.009
- **Sequence**: 5
- **Cluster Summary**: ### 1. Introduction & Theme Context
- The studies in this cluster primarily focus on assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and their implications on fertility and reproductive health. Key areas include the efficacy and outcomes of ART interventions like IVF and ICSI, the psychosocial and medical impacts of gestational surrogacy, and the long-term health implications for offspring conceived through ART.
- The clinical significance lies in addressing infertility, a condition affecting 15% of reproductive-aged couples globally, and improving ART success rates, which historically have been low but are improving due to technological advancements.

### 2. Treatment Types & Interventions
- **Gestational Surrogacy**: Increasingly used in the U.S., with support from state laws, and offered by 90% of CDC-reporting IVF centers.
- **In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI)**: Common ART methods involving in vitro handling of gametes. Success rates have improved due to advances in ovarian stimulation and embryo transfer techniques.
- **Intrauterine Insemination (IUI)**: Recommended for unexplained and moderate male factor subfertility, though its efficacy is debated.
- **Fertility Preservation in Cancer Patients**: Techniques include ovarian stimulation and non-hormonal methods, with no significant difference in cancer recurrence rates between methods.

### 3. Population & Methodology
- **Study Populations**: Diverse, including women with subfertility, cancer patients undergoing fertility preservation, and ethnic groups undergoing ART.
- **Sample Sizes**: Vary widely, with some studies involving thousands of participants (e.g., 31,629 women and 17,630 men in a cardiovascular study).
- **Study Designs**: Include systematic reviews, meta-analyses, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials. Methodologies often involve linking large health datasets to assess long-term outcomes.

### 4. Key Outcomes & Findings
- **Success Rates**: ART success rates have improved, with pregnancy rates doubling from 1994 to 2003. However, live birth rates remain below 30% per cycle.
- **Health Outcomes**: Women with subfertility have increased risks of cardiovascular diseases (e.g., stroke RR 1.18, coronary heart disease RR 1.16).
- **Ethnic Disparities**: Black and Asian women have lower ART success rates compared to white women, with black women facing higher risks of treatment failure at various stages (e.g., cycle cancellation RR 2.15).
- **Economic Barriers**: ART costs are prohibitively high in LMICs, often exceeding GDP per capita, limiting access to wealthier individuals.

### 5. Research Gaps & Limitations
- **Data on Poor Prognosis Groups**: Limited studies on women with few embryos or advanced reproductive age.
- **Long-term Offspring Health**: Uncertainty remains about the long-term impact of ART on offspring health.
- **Ethnic and Socioeconomic Factors**: Need for more research on how these factors influence ART outcomes and access.
- **ART Costs in LMICs**: Sparse data on ART affordability and financing in low-income settings.

### 6. Implications & Recommendations
- **Clinical Practice**: Improved ART techniques and personalized treatment plans could enhance success rates. Addressing ethnic disparities and economic barriers is crucial for equitable access.
- **Policy**: Governments, especially in LMICs, should consider integrating infertility treatments into national health policies to improve access and affordability.
- **Future Research**: Large, well-designed trials focusing on live birth outcomes and the impact of ART on long-term health are needed. Studies should also explore the role of socioeconomic and ethnic factors in ART success.
### Previous Section
- **Text**: Although many studies have shown that ICSI is not beneficial in cases of non-male factor infertility, it has continued to be used at high rates, and its effect on cumulative live birth rates (CLBRs) has not been studied in a large US population.It is possible that while using ICSI, CLBR might be impaired because only fully mature oocytes are inseminated, thus decreasing the pool of oocytes with potential for embryo development, whereas with standard insemination techniques, oocytes at various stages of maturation are inseminated (5) .There has also been a lack of cost analyses assessing the financial implications of this additional procedure.The purpose of our study was to assess CLBR while using ICSI vs. cIVF based on recent national data and perform a cost analysis comparing the 2 fertilization methods.We hypothesized that there is no improvement in CLBR when ICSI vs. cIVF is used in couples with non-male factor infertility.

### Next Section
- **Text**: The dataset included patients who underwent their first IVF autologous retrieval cycle between January 2014 and December 2015.We linked subsequent fresh and frozen embryo transfers occurring through December 2016 that used only embryos from the initial retrieval cycle to determine the CLBR.Cycles that included embryos from multiple retrieval cycles were excluded.Patients who used ''some ICSI,'' with missing ICSI data, who underwent single-gene analysis or genetic testing other than preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A), who were reported to have undergone PGT-A and a cleavage-stage embryo transfer or had missing data on genetic testing were excluded (Fig. 1 ).Patients with a diagnosis of male factor infertility, those who used donor sperm, and those who used frozen oocytes from the index cycle in a subsequent transfer cycle were also excluded.Although SART considers unknown outcomes as negative outcomes, this study excluded all cycles with unknown outcomes.Separate analyses of cycles that used ICSI vs. cIVF with no genetic testing or with PGT-A were performed.

### Section Details
- **Title**: A higher number of oocytes retrieved is associated with an increase in fertilized oocytes, blastocysts, and cumulative live birth rates
- **Text**: The data in the SART CORS are validated annually with 7%-10% of clinics receiving on-site visits for chart review on the basis of an algorithm for clinic selection.During each visit, data reported by the clinic were compared with information recorded in patients' charts.In 2019, records for 2,014 cycles at 34 clinics were randomly selected for full validation, along with 213 fertility preservation cycles selected for partial validation.The full validation included review of 1,300 cycles for which a pregnancy was reported.Nine of 11 data fields selected for validation were found to have discrepancy rates of %5% (15) .The exceptions were the diagnosis field, which, depending on the diagnosis, had a discrepancy rate between 2.5% and 17.8%, and the start date, which had a discrepancy rate of 8.4%.Obstetric outcomes from Massachusetts assisted reproductive technology records during 2004-2008 have been validated to have >95% agreement with vital records (16) .

### Previous Section
- **Text**: This was a retrospective study using autologous IVF retrieval cycles (IVF, oocyte banking, and embryo banking cycles) and linked FETs from IVF clinics in the United States between 2014 and 2019.The data used for this study were obtained from the SART CORS.Data were collected through voluntary submission, verified by the SART, and reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in compliance with the Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-493).The SART maintains Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant business associate agreements with reporting clinics.In 2004, after a contract change with the CDC, the SART gained access to the SART CORS data system for the purposes of conducting research.In 2017, 82% of all assisted reproductive technology clinics in the United States were SART members (15) .

### Section Details
- **Title**: A higher number of oocytes retrieved is associated with an increase in fertilized oocytes, blastocysts, and cumulative live birth rates
- **Text**: This was a retrospective study using autologous IVF retrieval cycles (IVF, oocyte banking, and embryo banking cycles) and linked FETs from IVF clinics in the United States between 2014 and 2019.The data used for this study were obtained from the SART CORS.Data were collected through voluntary submission, verified by the SART, and reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in compliance with the Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-493).The SART maintains Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant business associate agreements with reporting clinics.In 2004, after a contract change with the CDC, the SART gained access to the SART CORS data system for the purposes of conducting research.In 2017, 82% of all assisted reproductive technology clinics in the United States were SART members (15) .

- **Sequence**: 7
- **Cluster Summary**: ### 1. Introduction & Theme Context
- The studies in this cluster primarily focus on assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and their implications on fertility and reproductive health. Key areas include the efficacy and outcomes of ART interventions like IVF and ICSI, the psychosocial and medical impacts of gestational surrogacy, and the long-term health implications for offspring conceived through ART.
- The clinical significance lies in addressing infertility, a condition affecting 15% of reproductive-aged couples globally, and improving ART success rates, which historically have been low but are improving due to technological advancements.

### 2. Treatment Types & Interventions
- **Gestational Surrogacy**: Increasingly used in the U.S., with support from state laws, and offered by 90% of CDC-reporting IVF centers.
- **In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI)**: Common ART methods involving in vitro handling of gametes. Success rates have improved due to advances in ovarian stimulation and embryo transfer techniques.
- **Intrauterine Insemination (IUI)**: Recommended for unexplained and moderate male factor subfertility, though its efficacy is debated.
- **Fertility Preservation in Cancer Patients**: Techniques include ovarian stimulation and non-hormonal methods, with no significant difference in cancer recurrence rates between methods.

### 3. Population & Methodology
- **Study Populations**: Diverse, including women with subfertility, cancer patients undergoing fertility preservation, and ethnic groups undergoing ART.
- **Sample Sizes**: Vary widely, with some studies involving thousands of participants (e.g., 31,629 women and 17,630 men in a cardiovascular study).
- **Study Designs**: Include systematic reviews, meta-analyses, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials. Methodologies often involve linking large health datasets to assess long-term outcomes.

### 4. Key Outcomes & Findings
- **Success Rates**: ART success rates have improved, with pregnancy rates doubling from 1994 to 2003. However, live birth rates remain below 30% per cycle.
- **Health Outcomes**: Women with subfertility have increased risks of cardiovascular diseases (e.g., stroke RR 1.18, coronary heart disease RR 1.16).
- **Ethnic Disparities**: Black and Asian women have lower ART success rates compared to white women, with black women facing higher risks of treatment failure at various stages (e.g., cycle cancellation RR 2.15).
- **Economic Barriers**: ART costs are prohibitively high in LMICs, often exceeding GDP per capita, limiting access to wealthier individuals.

### 5. Research Gaps & Limitations
- **Data on Poor Prognosis Groups**: Limited studies on women with few embryos or advanced reproductive age.
- **Long-term Offspring Health**: Uncertainty remains about the long-term impact of ART on offspring health.
- **Ethnic and Socioeconomic Factors**: Need for more research on how these factors influence ART outcomes and access.
- **ART Costs in LMICs**: Sparse data on ART affordability and financing in low-income settings.

### 6. Implications & Recommendations
- **Clinical Practice**: Improved ART techniques and personalized treatment plans could enhance success rates. Addressing ethnic disparities and economic barriers is crucial for equitable access.
- **Policy**: Governments, especially in LMICs, should consider integrating infertility treatments into national health policies to improve access and affordability.
- **Future Research**: Large, well-designed trials focusing on live birth outcomes and the impact of ART on long-term health are needed. Studies should also explore the role of socioeconomic and ethnic factors in ART success.

### Next Section
- **Text**: The data in the SART CORS are validated annually with 7%-10% of clinics receiving on-site visits for chart review on the basis of an algorithm for clinic selection.During each visit, data reported by the clinic were compared with information recorded in patients' charts.In 2019, records for 2,014 cycles at 34 clinics were randomly selected for full validation, along with 213 fertility preservation cycles selected for partial validation.The full validation included review of 1,300 cycles for which a pregnancy was reported.Nine of 11 data fields selected for validation were found to have discrepancy rates of %5% (15) .The exceptions were the diagnosis field, which, depending on the diagnosis, had a discrepancy rate between 2.5% and 17.8%, and the start date, which had a discrepancy rate of 8.4%.Obstetric outcomes from Massachusetts assisted reproductive technology records during 2004-2008 have been validated to have >95% agreement with vital records (16) .
